    "description": "A two-story brick house with multiple dormer windows is presented in two slightly different perspectives. The house has a dark shingled roof, a bright teal front door, and is surrounded by trees and a well-kept lawn. The sunlight
indicates a daytime setting, likely late morning or early afternoon. One image shows the front of the house at a slight angle and the other 
image shows a more head-on view of the front, showcasing an adjacent flowering tree.",
